            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun - a dusty, cold, desert world
            with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with
            seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence
            that it was even more active in the past.

            Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest
            planet in the solar system - more than twice as massive as all the
            other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually
            cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere
            of hydrogen and helium.
